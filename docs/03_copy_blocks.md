## WHAT WE DO

We operate at the intersection of strategy, execution, and ownership. Engagements are structured around where we can create real leverage.

### Advisory & Consulting
Hands-on executive advisory across strategy, operations, growth, product, and systems. Built for teams ready to implement, not observe.

### Venture Studio
We incubate, build, and scale ventures internally and with aligned partners, applying proven systems across product, operations, and distribution.

### Strategic Equity Partnerships
In select cases, we take equity in exchange for executive leadership and operational execution. Capital may be involved — execution always is.

---

## HOW WE PARTNER

We don’t believe in one-size-fits-all engagements. Every partnership is structured around outcomes, incentives, and execution responsibility.

### Engagement Models
- **Advisory:** Retainers or defined projects  
- **Hybrid:** Cash + equity  
- **Equity for Execution:** Hands-on leadership with ownership

### What We Don’t Do
- No generic coaching or courses  
- No free consulting  
- No passive investing  
- No engagements without decision access  
- No high-volume client work
