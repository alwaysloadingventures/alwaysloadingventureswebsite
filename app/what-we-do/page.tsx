      <h1>What We Do</h1>
      <p>
        We operate at the intersection of strategy, execution, and ownership.
        Engagements are structured around where we can create real leverage.
      </p>

      <section>
        <h2>Advisory & Consulting</h2>
        <p>
          Hands-on executive advisory across strategy, operations, growth,
          product, and systems. Built for teams ready to implement, not observe.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Venture Studio</h2>
        <p>
          We incubate, build, and scale ventures internally and with aligned
          partners, applying proven systems across product, operations, and
          distribution.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Strategic Equity Partnerships</h2>
        <p>
          In select cases, we take equity in exchange for executive leadership
          and operational execution. Capital may be involved — execution always
          is.
